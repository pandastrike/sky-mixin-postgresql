    type:
      description: >
        The EC2 instance class for use within the Neptune cluster.  Defaults to db.r4.large, the smallest instance class.
      type: string
      enum:

        - "db.r4.8xlarge"

    replicaCount:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the number of read replica instances in the cluster.  There is one primary instance with a write endpoint and up to 15 replicas to provide read concurrency.  Replicas are staggered so half end up in availability zone 1 and half in zone 2.  Neptune clusters automatically handles failover cases.  This value defaults to 0.
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 15

    backupTTL:
      description: >
        Optional specification of how long to hold onto database snapshots, given in days.  Defaults to 1 day.
      type: integer
      minimum: 1

    backupWindow:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the window of time where a database backup can be made.  Given in UTC in the format hh:mm-hh:mm. Cannot overlap with maintenanceWindow. Defaults to 06:00-07:00, which is 11pm - 12am PST.  Zone 2 instances are staggered one hour afterward.
      type: string

    maintenanceWindow:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the window of time where system maintenance may occur, including version upgrades.  Given in UTC in the format ddd:hh:mm-ddd:hh:mm.  Cannot overlap with backupWindow.  Defaults to "Wed:07:00-Wed:08:00", which is 12am - 1am PST Wednesday mornings.  Zone 2 instances are staggered one hour afterward.

    allowMajorUpgrades:
      description: >
        Optional specification to allow major Neptune engine upgrades on your instances. Defaults to false.
      type: boolean

    allowMinorUpgrades:
      description: >
        Optional specification to allow minor Neptune engine upgrades on your instances. Defaults to true.
      type: boolean

    kmsKey:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the KMS key to use to encrypt data at rest.  Neptune uses KMS to encrypt/decrypt data with minimal performance impact.  This mixin does not create a KMS key for you and will throw an error if it cannot find the key.  Omitting this field will leave your data unencrypted at rest.
